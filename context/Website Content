HealthPaws: One Tap Veterinary System
Veterinary Record Management System

Introduction:
Managing veterinary records involves handling multiple details such as pet profiles, vaccination histories, medical records, appointments, and billing. Traditional paper-based or fragmented systems often result in misplaced records, inefficient retrieval, and missed vaccination schedules.
HealthPaws addresses these issues by providing a centralized digital platform designed for veterinary clinics and pet owners. It ensures accurate, secure, and easily accessible records. Its key feature is the digital vaccination card, giving pet owners convenient access to their pet’s health information anytime, anywhere.
HealthPaws will be introduced as a Software as a Service (SaaS), requiring subscription for access. SaaS ensures that hosting, maintenance, and database security are managed efficiently.

Objectives:
To digitize all veterinary records for security, accuracy, and efficiency
To highlight vaccination management with due date tracking
